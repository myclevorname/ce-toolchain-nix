      This package provides a compiler and linker for (e)Z80 targets
      based on the LLVM toolchain.
      Originally designed for the TI-84 Plus CE, this also works for the Agon Light.
      
      This does not provide fasmg or any include files to build the programs.
      Please install a toolchain, such as the CE C toolchain.
