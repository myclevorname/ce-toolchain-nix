# ez80-llvm and CE Toolchain for Nixpkgs

This is meant to be a set of Nix package definitions for the LLVM (e)Z80 port
and the CE C toolchain.

Currently, this only provides `llvm-ez80`, which is building at the time of writing this README.

To build this, you need to copy the two directories to the correct locations in the nixpkgs Git repo.
